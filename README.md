# Simple Gold Value Calculator

This was a simple side project that I was working on while trying to build a gold value calcutor for [The Alloy Market](https://thealloymarket.com). The calculator that we ended up building needed a lot more modifications but we figured we would share this simple one in case anyone was looking for a simple gold calculator.


Customization Options

Font Family: Adjust the font-family in the body selector to change the font throughout the calculator.

Colors: Modify the color and background-color properties in the CSS to customize text and background colors. The button color can be changed by adjusting the background-color property under the button selector.

Border Radius: To change the roundness of the input fields and button, adjust the border-radius property.

Button (CTA) Styling: The button's hover effect can be customized by changing the properties under button:hover. Adjusting the background-color, color, and other properties here will affect the button's appearance on hover.
